### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently a student at Fullstack Academy. I have built web applications with the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, NodeJS) stack. I've also built simple CRUD apps with React, Express, NodeJS, and SQL using Sequelize. I enjoy working with others and creating things. I love coding!!

âš¡ Fun fact: I love traveling and playing golf! I've been to Thailand, Italy, Mexico, Japan, Montreal and South Korea. Favorite place so far has to be Japan!

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently a student at Fullstack Academy. I have built web applications with the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, NodeJS) SERN (SQL, Express, React, NodeJS)  stack. 

âš¡ Fun fact: I love traveling and playing golf! I've been to Thailand, Italy, Mexico, Japan, Montreal and South Korea. Favorite place so far has to be Japan!
